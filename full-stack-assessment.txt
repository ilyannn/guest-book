Please build a simple "guest book" web application with a SQLite database, a
Python backend and a React or Vue frontend. The application should be simple but
also usable and secure.

The application should present a form with text inputs for the submitterâ€™s name
and a message. Both fields are required. Entries should persist to the SQLite
database along with the submission time.

On the same page, display a list of entries in descending chronological order,
limited to ten entries. Each entry in the list should display the entry time,
submitter name, and message, and a "Delete" button to remove the entry. The list
does not need to be paginated.

Above the list, present a form with a text input for the search query and a
"Search" button. When the form is submitted, update the entry list to include
only entries that contain the search query text in the submitter name or entry
message.

Please deliver the application as a .tar.gz or .zip archive, with development
artifacts (i.e. `node_modules`) removed. include any scripts needed to run the
application and a README with instructions to set it up. Note any platform
requirements and if possible support both macOS and Linux.
